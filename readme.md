# Lab7 Dynamics

As shown in the video `Dynamics.webm`, the torques varies as the motion of the manipulator.  
The simulation results (`sim_torques/joint_i`) are close to the real feedback values (`real_torques/joint_i`).  
But these two values are not exactly the same due to the numerical calculation error and varience of the inertia of the links.
